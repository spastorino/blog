There’s been a very interesting and constructive debate about how to
market *Rust*, mainly motivated by [Steve Klabnik’s blog
post](http://words.stevekblanik.com/rust-is-more-than-safety), which was
later followed by [Graydon
Hoare’s](http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/247406.html), [Dave
Herman’s](https://thefeedbackloop.xyz/safety-is-rusts-fireflower/), and
others writings. I consider both *Mozilla* and the *Rust* community are
doing an excellent marketing job, as I’ve never seen any other
language/community doing so, but there’s always room for more
improvements.

Steve was asking all *Rust* lovers to give some thought to how the
language could be better marketed. For that, I think you’ll need to
precisely answer where *Rust* makes a huge difference for developers
when comparing it against other systems programming languages such as
*C/C++*. To me, *Rust* makes a huge difference in making systems
programming easier, more productive, more secure, and we could even say,
more fun :).

Systems programming being easier and more productive than alternatives
like *C/C++* has some consequences, such as enabling a new generation of
systems programmers, helping experienced ones write safer code and
having much more secure systems software in general. This would mean
fewer vulnerabilities, less maintenance work to do and on top of that,
increased productivity.

Systems programming being more secure (at some point I bet *Rust* is
going to prove that it really helps developers to construct safer
solutions) means that we could slowly change the entire software
ecosystem to one much more secure than the one we have now.
The *Rust* community and myself included dream of a world where we can
avoid most of the zillions of bugs and *CVEs* we usually see in systems
software by replacing software piece by piece with new versions written
in a safer language like *Rust*. This includes user and server programs
computers use on a daily basis such as browsers, web servers, mail
servers, *TLS* libraries, operating systems, etc.
*Mozilla* is already taking these steps with [Servo](https://servo.org/)
and [Quantum](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum). Maybe someday software
like *OpenSSL*, could be rewritten in *Rust* which would mean
(hopefully) seeing less *CVEs* than what we are nowadays used to.

Going back to the blog posts discussions, they used a *Super Mario Bros*
analogy where *Mario (the customer) + Fire Flower (your product) => Fire
Mario (Awesome person who can do rad stuff)*. What you want to market is
the *Fire Mario* not the *Fire Flower*.
So to me, *making systems programming easier, more productive and more
secure are the Fire Flowers, and enabling a new generation of systems
programmers, helping experienced ones write safer code with fewer
vulnerabilities and at the end having much more secure systems software
in general* are the *Fire Marios*.
I think *Rust* is being marketed in all those fire Mario’s fronts but
it’s targeting much more to the new generation of systems programmers
and that’s awesome, but I’d also love to see more energy invested in
targeting the experienced systems programmers and its ecosystem.
